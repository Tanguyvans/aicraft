# Vastai-Expert Showcase: Automated PyTorch Training Deployment

## Test Prompt

**User Request:**
"I need to deploy this PyTorch training script on Vast.AI: https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/main/mnist

I want to train the MNIST model on GPU. I have my Vast.AI API key and a budget of around $2/hour. Can you set up the complete automated deployment?"

## Expected Capabilities Showcase

This test should demonstrate:

1. **Automatic code analysis** - Detecting PyTorch framework and requirements
2. **Optimal instance selection** - Finding GPU instances within budget
3. **Complete deployment automation** - Single script that handles everything
4. **Cost optimization** - Auto-stop and budget management
5. **Error handling** - Fallback strategies and recovery
